Interactive Visualiztions using JavaScript and D3.js

This repository contains an interactive dashboard built using D3.js to visualize biological data. The project contains a bar chart,
a bubble chart, and a panel with demographic information. Users can select a sample from a dropdown menu and dynamically create
the visualizations. The dashboard can be found at https://njvoltin.github.io/belly_button_challenge/

The features on the dashboard include 

1. Horizontal Bar Chart:
  Displays the top 10 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) for the selected sample.
  Includes sample values, OTU IDs, and hover text for more details.
2. Bubble Chart:
  Visualizes all OTUs for the selected sample.
  OTU IDs determine marker colors, sample values determine marker sizes.
3. Demographic Information Panel:
  Displays metadata such as age, gender, and other details of the selected sample.
4. Interactive Dropdown Menu:
  Updates all visualizations when a new sample is selected.

Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.
